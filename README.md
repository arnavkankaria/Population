# Population
This program calculates how many years it will take an initial amount of population to reach a given amount, assuming a third of the population is born each year and a fourth of the population passes away. Some features of this program are from a course I am doing. I will update those features soon.

To compile and run the program:
1. make population
2. ./population

To use the program:
1. Enter starting population and ending population (starting population must be above 9 and ending population must be equal to or larger than the starting population)
2. The program will output amount of years
